# Project Tracks

This file is the source of truth for active execution order. Archived tracks live in `conductor/archive/`. The milestone-level delivery sequence lives in [./roadmap.md](./roadmap.md).

---

## Active Track

- No active track. The next `/conductor` run should open a new track only if the roadmap gains a new queued item.

## Planned Queue

- No planned queue.

  *Closeout: archived on 2026-03-14 after locking Unit 1 to the canonical redesign contract in docs and authored runtime content, adding regression guards for the shared workbook/dataset/presentation flow, and recording Wave 2's dependency on the accepted exemplar.*

- [x] **Track: Curriculum Rollout Wave 1 (Units 2-4)**
  *Link: [./archive/curriculum_rollout_wave1_20260313/](./archive/curriculum_rollout_wave1_20260313/)*
  *Closeout: archived on 2026-03-13 after replacing Units 2-4 generated curriculum scaffolds with canonical authored published lessons sourced from the active planning matrices and verified through full lint, test, and build gates.*

- [x] **Track: Unit 1 Canonicalization and Archetype Exemplars**
  *Link: [./archive/unit1_canonicalization_archetypes_20260313/](./archive/unit1_canonicalization_archetypes_20260313/)*
  *Closeout: archived on 2026-03-13 after canonicalizing Unit 1 authored lesson contracts at the source, removing legacy publish-time special casing, and unifying student/teacher published lesson presentation through one helper.*
- [x] **Track: Teacher Monitoring Core**
  *Link: [./archive/teacher_monitoring_core_20260313/](./archive/teacher_monitoring_core_20260313/)*
  *Closeout: archived on 2026-03-13 after adding the missing lesson-level teacher monitoring route, hardening prerender fallbacks for the landing page, and fixing the stale phase-completion client hook path.*
- [x] **Track: Student Study Runtime**
  *Link: [./archive/student_study_runtime_20260313/](./archive/student_study_runtime_20260313/)*
  *Closeout: archived on 2026-03-13 after finishing the student lesson resume/completion loop and aligning public curriculum copy with the protected student lesson route.*

- [x] **Track: Curriculum Authoring-to-Publish Pipeline**
  *Link: [./archive/curriculum_authoring_publish_pipeline_20260313/](./archive/curriculum_authoring_publish_pipeline_20260313/)*
