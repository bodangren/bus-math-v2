# Unit 6 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Inventory & Project Costing Intelligence)

> Focus: Track and value inventory and project costs using FIFO/LIFO and WIP (Work in Progress). Students integrate cost-flow methods into financial statements and update the cash summary. Sarah’s narrative centers on client project costing and materials management.

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Introduce inventory concepts & relevance to service business | Explain FIFO and LIFO | Apply FIFO to sample dataset | Apply LIFO to same dataset | Compare FIFO/LIFO results and implications | Introduce project costing & WIP tracking | Build combined inventory + project costing table | Group project: apply to Sarah’s client dataset | Group project: debug & analysis | Present dashboard & conclusions | Individual mastery quiz |
| **Accounting Focus** | Inventory as asset and cost | Cost flow assumptions | FIFO valuation | LIFO valuation | Compare cost of goods sold (COGS) & profit impacts | Project costing structure (materials, labor, overhead) | Integrate COGS + WIP into statements | Realistic costing simulation | Analysis & presentation | Communication of cost findings | Summative demonstration |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | Table setup for purchases & sales | `INDEX/MATCH` basics | Dynamic array formulas for FIFO | Dynamic array formulas for LIFO | Comparative table & conditional bars | Multi-factor calculations (materials + labor + overhead) | Combine FIFO/LIFO + WIP table | Chart creation (sparklines, trendlines) | Dashboard formatting & validation | Presentation export | Timed build (array + chart) |
| **Formative Product** | Exit ticket: define inventory | FIFO manual worksheet | FIFO Excel sheet | LIFO Excel sheet | Comparison chart | WIP costing worksheet | Combined cost dashboard draft | Group dashboard v1 | Group dashboard v2 | Presentation file | Quiz + mini model |
| **Entry / Launch** | Scenario: Sarah’s café client has supply issues | Warm-up: stock photos vs real goods | Discuss rising prices | Reflect on timing of purchases | — | Story: project costing confusion | Review WIP examples | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini-Lesson / Concept Intro** | Why inventory matters | FIFO explained visually | FIFO Excel setup | LIFO logic explained | Compare cost assumptions | Introduce project costing | Integrate tables | — | — | — | — |
| **Guided Practice** | Manual FIFO example | Build FIFO in Excel | Test FIFO formula | Build LIFO formulas | Compare with chart | Create WIP example | Combine datasets | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Individual practice | Partner FIFO build | Individual LIFO build | Partner test | Individual analysis | Independent costing | Individual integration | **Group Work Day**: apply to client dataset | **Group Work Day**: refine & analyze | **Group Work Day**: present | **Individual Work Only**: quiz + build |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | Why inventory costs shift | What challenges in FIFO? | How accurate were your results? | Why do assumptions matter? | Which method fits inflation? | What drives project cost accuracy? | What’s hard about combining datasets? | Peer feedback | Communication clarity | Audience reaction | Post-test reflection |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Exit ticket | FIFO sheet check | FIFO accuracy | LIFO accuracy | Comparison verified | WIP sheet check | **Milestone ①:** Combined cost dashboard | Peer checklist | Teacher spot-check | **Milestone ②:** Presentation | **Summative quiz** |

**Teacher Notes**
- Present FIFO/LIFO through relatable examples (e.g., food inventory for café client, software licenses for Sarah’s projects).  
- Reinforce that service firms track project costs similarly to physical inventory via **Work in Progress**.  
- Have students visualize FIFO/LIFO results with conditional formatting bars or sparklines.  
- Update **Cash Summary** to include inventory purchases (cash outflow) and cost recognition.  
- Extension: introduce basic **inventory turnover ratio** as a performance metric.
