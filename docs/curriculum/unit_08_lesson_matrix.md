% Update: created full lesson planning matrix for Unit 8 (Integrated Model Sprint)

# Unit 8 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Integrated Model Sprint)

> Focus: Assemble the fully linked 3-statement model (Income, Balance, **full Indirect Cash Flow**) and build an investor-ready dashboard. No macros; use CHOOSE + Goal Seek + (optional) Data Tables. Emphasize auditing, scenario logic, and clear storytelling.

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Kickoff: model architecture & sheet roles | Re-link Income Statement from assumptions | Re-link Balance Sheet drivers & validations | Build full **Indirect Cash Flow** (Ops/Inv/Fin) | Implement scenario inputs and CHOOSE logic | Add Goal Seek for target outcomes | Design KPI dashboard (cash runway, margin, leverage) | Group project: audit & stress test model | Group project: storyboard & script the pitch | Present integrated model & dashboard | Individual post-assessment |
| **Accounting Focus** | Statement interactions & dependencies | Revenue/COGS/OpEx assumptions → IS | Working capital, PPE, equity, debt on BS | Indirect CF: NI + adjustments + ΔWC + Inv/Fin | Scenario levers (price, volume, tax, rate) | Hitting targets (profit, coverage, runway) | KPI selection & definitions | Reconciliation & reasonableness | Clear narrative and limitations | Professional communication | Mastery of linkages |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | Sheet map, named ranges, consistent labels | Cross-sheet links; error checks | Data validation, circular checks | CF build: adjustments (Dep), ΔAR, ΔAP, ΔInv; investing & financing | `CHOOSE` for scenario switch; input table design | **Goal Seek** to hit target NI/cash | Slicers (if available), charts, sparklines, dynamic headers | Audit tools (Trace Precedents), formula documentation | Slide export, print areas, one-pager | Live demo polish (freeze panes, zoom, reveal) | Timed repair of broken links |
| **Formative Product** | Architecture diagram of model | Working Income Statement from inputs | Balance Sheet proof (A=L+E) & flags | Complete Indirect Cash Flow sheet | Scenario input block + CHOOSE cells | Goal Seek worksheet (target + result) | KPI dashboard draft (3–4 visuals) | Group audit checklist (pass) | Pitch deck draft + demo script | Final deck + model hand-in | Quiz + repair exercise |
| **Entry / Launch** | Review prior units’ tabs to import | Warm-up: find IS drivers | Warm-up: list BS drivers | Case: why indirect vs direct CF | Scenario ideation | Target-setting discussion | Show 3 example dashboards | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini-Lesson / Concept Intro** | Architecture & naming conventions | Build IS from assumptions | BS drivers & retained earnings recap | Indirect CF structure & typical adjustments | Scenario logic with CHOOSE | Goal Seek caveats & ethics | Dashboard design principles (ink-to-data) | — | — | — | **Brief test directions** |
| **Guided Practice** | Map tabs and name key ranges | Link revenue → IS | Link to BS totals & validations | Walk through Ops/Inv/Fin sections | Build CHOOSE cell together | Run Goal Seek example | Build one KPI chart live | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Individual map & names | Individual IS link | Individual BS link | Independent CF build | Pair scenario setup | Individual Goal Seek target | Individual dashboard build | **Group Work Day**: audit & stress test | **Group Work Day**: storyboard & rehearse | **Group Work Day**: present | **Individual Work Only**: post-assessment |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | What dependencies surprised you? | Which assumption changed NI most? | Where did A=L+E fail? | What does CF reveal that IS doesn’t? | Which levers matter most? | What tradeoff did Goal Seek expose? | Which KPI best tells the story? | What did audit catch? | What story are you telling? | What feedback will you keep? | What will you repair faster next time? |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Architecture diagram collected | IS link check | BS validation = pass | **Milestone ①:** Cash Flow sheet complete | Scenario block check | Goal Seek worksheet check | **Milestone ②:** KPI dashboard draft | Peer audit checklist | Teacher spot-check | **Milestone ③:** Final presentation | **Summative quiz** |

**Teacher Notes**
- Keep indirect CF consistent with units 4–7: add back Depreciation; incorporate ΔAR/ΔAP/ΔInventory; PPE purchases (Investing); loan proceeds/repayments & member contributions/distributions (Financing).  
- No macros. Prefer `CHOOSE`, Goal Seek, and (optional) 1–2 variable Data Tables for sensitivity.  
- Require an **Audit Checklist** (links, signs, totals, naming) before presentation.  
- Dashboard KPIs suggestions: Ending Cash/Runway, Gross Margin %, Current Ratio, Interest Coverage, Debt/Equity.  
- Deliverables: **Integrated workbook**, **KPI dashboard**, **5–7 slide deck**, and a **90–120 sec live demo** of the model’s levers.
