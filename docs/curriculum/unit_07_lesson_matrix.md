# Unit 7 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Financing the Future)

> Focus: Financing options for an LLC—loans, member contributions, and distributions—plus interest expense and repayment schedules. Students build amortization schedules, compare financing choices, and integrate **financing cash flows** into the model (no Scenario Manager; use CHOOSE + Data Tables + Goal Seek where helpful).

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Introduce financing choices for an LLC | Distinguish member equity vs. debt | Build a loan amortization schedule | Calculate interest (IPMT) and principal (PPMT) | Model member contributions & distributions | Compare cost of capital scenarios | Link financing flows into statements & cash summary | Group project: choose a financing plan for Sarah | Group project: stress test & refine | Present financing recommendation | Individual mastery check |
| **Accounting Focus** | Financing types and implications | Equity (member interests) vs. liabilities | Loan structure: term, rate, payment | Interest expense recognition | Owner contributions and distributions | Weighing risk, cost, and control | Financing cash flows vs income effects | Decision memo & documentation | Sensitivity to rate/term changes | Persuasive financial communication | Independent application |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | Inputs table (rate, term, amount) | `PMT` for payment calc | Amortization layout | `IPMT`, `PPMT` columns | Equity activity table | `CHOOSE` for scenario switch; **Goal Seek** for target payment | Cross-sheet links; update cash summary (financing) | Scenario table (manual or Data Table) | Data validation and error flags | Chart: payment vs. interest over time | Timed build (PMT + IPMT + link) |
| **Formative Product** | Exit ticket: list 2 financing types | Equity vs. debt T-chart | PMT worksheet | IPMT/PPMT sheet | Equity activity log | Scenario comparison sheet | Linked financing tab | Group plan v1 | Group plan v2 + checks | Slides + chart + memo | Quiz + mini amortization build |
| **Entry / Launch** | Story: Sarah considers growth loan vs. member cash-in | Warm-up: pros/cons brainstorm | Mini case: bank term sheet | Review interest math | Scenario: owner distribution timing | Rate shock thought experiment | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini-Lesson / Concept Intro** | Financing overview | Equity vs. debt rules for LLC | Amortization concept & setup | Interest/principal split | Owner equity flows | Scenario modeling without macros | Where financing hits IS/BS/CF | — | — | — | **Brief test directions** |
| **Guided Practice** | Identify financing need inputs | Build PMT together | Layout columns & first rows | Fill IPMT/PPMT formulas | Create owner contrib/distrib table | Build CHOOSE-driven scenario cells | Update cash summary (fin/ops split) | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Individual inputs table | Partner PMT check | Individual amortization build | Individual interest/principal | Individual equity table | Pair scenario compare | Individual linking & checks | **Group Work Day**: draft recommendation | **Group Work Day**: stress test/refine | **Group Work Day**: present | **Individual Work Only**: quiz + build |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | What does “cost of capital” mean to you? | When is debt better than equity? | What surprised you in payments? | How does interest expense affect profit? | Why do distributions reduce equity? | Which scenario is most resilient? | What changed in cash summary? | Peer feedback | Biggest risk you found? | Audience reactions | What did you master today? |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Exit ticket | T-chart collected | PMT check | IPMT/PPMT check | Equity log check | Scenario sheet check | **Milestone ①:** Financing linked to statements | Peer checklist | Teacher spot-check | **Milestone ②:** Presentation & memo | **Summative quiz** |

**Teacher Notes**
- Keep terminology LLC-accurate: **member contributions, distributions, member equity**.  
- No Scenario Manager: use **CHOOSE + Goal Seek** and optional **1- or 2-variable Data Tables**.  
- Integrate interest expense to the Income Statement; principal to financing cash flows; update Balance Sheet for loan and equity balances.  
- Encourage a short written **Financing Recommendation Memo** citing cost, risk, and control trade-offs.  
- Chart suggestion: stacked column of payment split (interest vs principal) over time.  
- Optional extension: brief note on **LLC → C-corp conversion** as a future path for outside equity.
