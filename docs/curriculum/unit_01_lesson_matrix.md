# Unit 1 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Balance by Design)

> Columns = **Lesson 1 → 11**. Rows = top-level focuses (objective, accounting, Excel, formative product) followed by instructional **phases**. Project days (L8–L10) collapse to Group Work + Checkpoint; Test day (L11) collapses to Individual Work only.

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Launch unit; introduce A=L+E and why balance matters | Classify accounts into A/L/E using real examples | Apply A/L/E to simple business events (no debits/credits yet) | Build a simple Balance Sheet structure from categorized data | Detect and fix common ledger errors | Enforce data quality with validation; prep for snapshot | Compile a clean **Balance Snapshot** with a basic visual | Project work: refine ledger + documentation | Project work: polish snapshot + narrative | Project work: rehearse + finalize public product | **Individual assessment**: classify accounts & balance mini-case |
| **Accounting Focus** | Accounting equation; definitions of Asset, Liability, Equity | Account types; normal sense-making (what belongs where) | Transaction effects on A/L/E (conceptual, dual-impact idea) | Balance Sheet sections & subtotals (Assets, Liabilities, Equity) | Error patterns: misclassification; missing entries | Data integrity supporting accurate Balance Sheet | Mini Balance Sheet completeness & clarity | Apply A/L/E to team dataset | Explain balance logic to an audience | Public-ready Balance Sheet and rationale | Mastery check of A/L/E & BS skeleton |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | Orientation; file hygiene; basic formatting | **Excel Table** from CSV; headers; number formats | `SUMIF` by category; structured references | Template layout; alignment; labeled sections | **Conditional Formatting** red flags (missing type, negative asset) | **Data Validation** lists for A/L/E; consistent account names | Chart basics (bar); print layout; page setup | Version control; comments; checklist use | Visual polish; captioning; screenshot best practices | Export & submit; naming conventions | Short build in-sheet (2–3 tasks) under time |
| **Formative Product** | Exit ticket: define A/L/E in your own words | Categorized list (A/L/E) in Table; turn-in screenshot | Equation-check cell passes for 5–7 events | Draft mini BS (≥ 6 core accounts) | Red-flag report: all issues resolved | Validation passes; zero blanks/mismatches | **Balance Snapshot v0.9** + bar chart (Assets vs Liabilities) | Peer-review checklist completed | 60‑sec micro‑pitch script + updated snapshot | Final **Mini Balance Sheet** + ledger package | Graded quiz + tiny build (auto-marked) |
| **Entry / Launch** | Entry event: messy notebook → need for balance | Quick case warm‑up | Scenario hook | Prompt with sample BS | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini‑Lesson / Concept Intro** | What is A=L+E? Why it’s always true | What counts as an Asset vs Liability vs Equity | How events change balance without D/C mechanics | BS skeleton (assets/liabilities/equity blocks) | Common errors & how to spot them | Data validation rules & why they matter | Visual communication: labeling & totals | — | — | — | **Brief test directions** |
| **Guided Practice** | Sort real‑life items into A/L/E (cards) | Convert CSV → Table; tag account types | Write 5 event rows; watch A/L/E totals | Map categorized rows to BS sections | Build red‑flag rules together | Create validation lists; test edge cases | Build bar chart; check totals/labels | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Pair sort → share out | Individual Table build | Pair compute `SUMIF` totals | Individual BS draft | Fix errors independently | Clean dataset; pass validation | Assemble snapshot & notes | **Group Work Day**: refine ledger & doc | **Group Work Day**: polish visuals & explanation | **Group Work Day**: rehearsal & final edits | **Individual Work Only**: quiz + mini build |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | Why balance builds trust | “Gray zone” accounts discussion | What surprised you about event effects? | What makes a BS readable? | What errors did you catch today? | How did validation change your confidence? | What story does your snapshot tell? | Peer feedback highlights | Audience expectations & revisions | Personal checklist before submit | Quick post‑test reflection |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Exit ticket collected | Table + tags checked | Equation cell = TRUE | Draft BS meets rubric minima | Red‑flags all green | Validation = pass | **Milestone ①**: Snapshot v0.9 | Peer checklist score | Teacher spot‑check | **Milestone ②**: Final mini BS | **Summative quiz** |

**Notes for Teacher Use**
- **L8–L10** are intentionally collapsed to “Group Work Day” + **Checkpoint** cells—keep room for flexible timing, substitutions, or guest feedback.
- The **trial balance** concept is *not* assessed here; it appears later as a check in Unit 2.
- Keep the **Cash** account visible as the anchor asset, but reserve full cash‑flow mechanics for later units.
