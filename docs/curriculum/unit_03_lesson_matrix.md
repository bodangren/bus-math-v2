# Unit 3 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Statements in Balance)

> Focus: Integrate Income Statement and Balance Sheet; introduce closing entries; begin mini cash-flow logic. Build analytical understanding of how net income affects equity and liquidity.

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Connect Income Statement and Balance Sheet concepts | Review closing process conceptually | Build linked worksheets for Balance Sheet and Income Statement | Link net income to retained earnings | Build mini Operating Cash Summary | Analyze operating cash effects of key accounts | Peer‑test and troubleshoot linked statements | Group project: finalize 2‑statement workbook | Group project: integrate visuals and commentary | Presentation and peer feedback | Individual post‑assessment |
| **Accounting Focus** | Relationship of Income and Balance | Temporary vs permanent accounts | Closing entries (formula‑based, no macros) | Retained earnings flow | Operating vs non‑cash adjustments | Cash impact of timing differences | Reconciliation accuracy | Demonstrate financial statement coherence | Financial storytelling | Communicate results | Mastery check of linked statements |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | Review linking cells between sheets | Cross‑sheet references, named ranges | Template design: statement headers and totals | Link RE = RE_prev + NI | Build simple cash reconciliation (`NI + adj`) | Conditional formatting for cash increases/decreases | Debug broken links with Trace Precedents | Clean formatting, protect cells | Add stacked column / waterfall chart | Slide export / print layout | Short auto‑link quiz (repair exercise) |
| **Formative Product** | Exit ticket: how IS and BS connect | Annotated diagram: closing cycle | Linked worksheet skeleton | Linked NI→RE cell passes test | Mini cash summary (Ops only) | Color‑coded cash flow trends | Peer debug checklist | Group 2‑statement v1.0 | Group workbook v2.0 + visuals | Presentation rubric checklist | Quiz + reflection |
| **Entry / Launch** | Review Sarah’s Unit 2 ledger | Warm‑up: what happens to income at month‑end? | Short scenario: closing books for Sarah | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini‑Lesson / Concept Intro** | Explain how income affects equity | Define temporary vs permanent | Demonstrate formula‑based closing | Teach retained earnings formula | Teach operating cash adjustments | Show non‑cash examples (depr, AR/AP) | Walk through audit process | — | — | — | — |
| **Guided Practice** | Map accounts to statements | Build closing logic step by step | Link IS → BS cells | Validate RE formula | Create mini cash summary | Apply to sample dataset | Debug broken links | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Individual linking | Partner closing practice | Individual linking to totals | Pair check NI → RE | Independent mini cash summary | Individual adjustment test | Partner debug | **Group Work Day**: finalize | **Group Work Day**: visuals | **Group Work Day**: presentation | **Individual Work Only**: post‑assessment |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | What surprised you about closing? | Why separate temp vs perm accounts? | What errors did you fix today? | How did RE connection feel? | What did cash summary show? | What’s hardest to trace? | What tells you it balances? | Peer insights | Story clarity | What feedback mattered most? | What will you keep using? |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Exit ticket | Diagram collected | Formula check: links work | NI → RE verified | **Milestone ①:** Cash Summary v1 | Cash trends test | Debug checklist | Peer checklist | Teacher spot‑check | **Milestone ②:** Presentation & workbook | **Summative quiz** |

**Teacher Notes**
- Keep macro‑free by using formulas for closing entries (e.g., `=SUM(Revenue) - SUM(Expenses)` feeds retained earnings).
- Integrate a small **Operating Cash Summary** before the full Cash Flow Statement appears later.
- Encourage teams to color‑code temporary vs permanent accounts for clarity.
- Chart suggestion: stacked column or mini waterfall to show NI → Cash → Equity movement.
- Carry forward validated datasets from Unit 2 to ensure continuity in Sarah’s TechStart storyline.
