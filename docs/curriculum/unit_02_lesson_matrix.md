# Unit 2 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Flow of Transactions)

> Focus: Debit/Credit logic (DEA LER), T-Accounts, mini income statement. Lesson structure continues the project-based rhythm: concept introduction, guided practice, and progressive integration with Excel logic functions (IF, SWITCH, SUMIFS).

| **Row / Lesson** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** | **L6** | **L7** | **L8** | **L9** | **L10** | **L11** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lesson Objective** | Introduce Debit/Credit logic through visual T-Accounts | Apply DEA LER pattern to categorize transactions | Post 5–6 transactions into T-Accounts manually | Translate manual T-Accounts to structured Excel Tables | Use IF + SWITCH to automate account type logic | SUMIFS totals by account type | Build mini income statement from categorized data | Group project: apply to Sarah’s real transactions | Continue project: error check & peer review | Finalize project workbook & peer presentation | Individual mastery check (quiz + mini build) |
| **Accounting Focus** | Debit/Credit framework (DEA LER) | Understanding how transactions affect A/L/E | Journal entries vs T-Accounts | Trial balance (conceptual only) | Linking D/C logic to A/L/E categories | Aggregating revenue & expenses | Structure of income statement | Apply rules to authentic dataset | Debug mis-posted entries | Present clean income statement | Individual classification & posting |
| **Excel Skill Focus** | T-Account template layout | Basic formula copy & paste discipline | `IF` statements for normal balance side | Transition from manual to digital ledger | **`SWITCH`** for account-type mapping | `SUMIFS` by account type | Sheet layout for subtotals | Cross-sheet referencing, clean formatting | Peer debugging with error flags | Export, final proof, version control | Auto-check formulas under time |
| **Formative Product** | Exit ticket: identify D/C direction | DEA LER reference chart | Paper T-Accounts turned in | Excel T-Account table complete | Working SWITCH formula example | SUMIFS totals validated | Mini income statement draft | Group ledger v1.0 | Group ledger v2.0 + checklist | Final group ledger & income statement | Individual quiz and mini ledger build |
| **Entry / Launch** | Demo: business event animation | Quick recall of A=L+E | Warm-up: label sides D/C | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Mini‑Lesson / Concept Intro** | DEA LER explained with visuals | Practice identifying normal balance | How transactions update accounts | Transition to Excel | Explain SWITCH vs IF logic | Introduce SUMIFS with conditions | Explain income statement flow | — | — | — | **Brief test directions** |
| **Guided Practice** | Classify example accounts | Sort transactions into columns | Manual posting | Enter data into Excel Table | Build SWITCH column together | Test SUMIFS ranges | Organize subtotals by type | — | — | — | — |
| **Independent / Group Work** | Individual classification | Partner sorting | Individual posting | Partner Excel setup | Pair formula build | Individual testing | Build IS independently | **Group Work Day**: apply to dataset | **Group Work Day**: peer debug | **Group Work Day**: finalize & rehearse | **Individual Work Only**: quiz + mini build |
| **Reflection / Debrief** | Why D/C symmetry matters | Which accounts confuse you? | What errors did you see? | What changed moving to Excel? | When is SWITCH easier than IF? | What pattern do totals reveal? | How does income show up in A=L+E? | Peer feedback | Revision targets | Post‑project reflection | Quick post‑test journal |
| **Assessment / Checkpoint** | Exit ticket | DEA LER chart | Paper T‑Accounts | Excel T‑Accounts pass | SWITCH test cell correct | SUMIFS check pass | **Milestone ①:** Mini Income Statement draft | Peer checklist complete | Teacher spot‑check | **Milestone ②:** Final Income Statement | **Summative quiz** |

**Teacher Notes**
- SWITCH replaces nested IFs for normal balance classification.
- Trial balance appears as a **conceptual check**, not a separate report.
- Encourage color‑coded debit/credit columns with conditional formatting.
- Project phase (L8–L10) builds on Sarah’s data from Unit 1 (same ledger → income statement).
