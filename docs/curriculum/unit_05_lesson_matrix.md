% Update: created full lesson planning matrix for Unit 5 (Assets That Age)

# Unit 5 – Lesson Planning Matrix (Assets That Age)

> Focus: Depreciation methods (SLN, DDB), accumulated depreciation, and linkage to financial statements. Students integrate depreciation schedules into prior models and understand non-cash expense effects.

**Teacher Notes**
- Use Sarah’s new office purchase as authentic context.  
- Ensure students identify *cost, salvage, life, and method* for each asset.  
- Encourage visual comparison between SLN and DDB charts.  
- Emphasize that depreciation affects **Income Statement** (expense) and **Balance Sheet** (contra-asset), not cash flow.  
- Link updated totals into existing cash summary tab (add back depreciation).
